### Problem 0

This problem is just for setup. It covers  recommended approaches  to work with this repository. 

___

#### Operating Systems
All code will be eventually be packaged for [cloud virtual machines](https://cloud.google.com/) via [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). For path and dependency uniformity, Unix filesystems are required. 

Luckily, there are many options  in the cloud, on virtual machines, or next to your current OS: 

* [Windows 10](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) 
* [Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/sierra/)
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
 
 #### Editors

You will need an editor to write your code, but so long as the end result is functional, well documented, works in the repository's enviornment, and works with the rest of the codebase, it **does not matter how you write it**.

That said, there are a variety of editors and IDEs out there that may be hepful. I encourage you to explore as many as you like until you find a setup that works for you.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (:fire:)
* Notepad
* textEdit
* Notepad
* Vim 
* Nano 
* [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

 
#### Languages
The primary lanaguges preferred in this repository are:

* Python 3 
* Python 2
* Javascript
* C/C++
* Shell
